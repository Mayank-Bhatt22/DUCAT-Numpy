# DUCAT-Numpy
Learn NumPy at DUCAT to master numerical computing in Python. Gain hands-on experience with arrays, mathematical operations, data manipulation, and real-world problem solving essential for data analysis, machine learning, and scientific computing.

# NumPy – DUCAT Class Learning

This repository contains notes and practice code based on what I learned during my NumPy classes at DUCAT.
It focuses on building strong fundamentals of numerical computing using Python.

## What I Learned
- Creating and working with NumPy arrays
- Indexing, slicing, and reshaping arrays
- Mathematical and statistical operations
- Broadcasting concepts
- Efficient data manipulation techniques

## Purpose
This repository is for revision and practice, and to strengthen NumPy skills required for Data Analysis, Machine Learning, and Scientific Computing.
